                        <p>In the medical field,  augmented reality can be used as a visualization and training aid for future surgeons. It may be possible to collect 3D data sets of a patient in real time by using noninvasive sensors such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scans (CT), or ultrasound imaging. These virtual drawings could then be rendered and combined in real time with a view of the patient, superimposing medical terminology in effect for personalized usage. In effect, this would give a doctor "X-ray vision" inside a patient. This ability would be very useful during minimally invasive surgery, which reduces the trauma of an operation by using small incisions or no incisions at all. A problem with minimally invasive techniques is that they reduce the doctor's ability to see inside the patient, making surgery more difficult.

<br>
<br>
AR technology could provide an internal view without the need for larger incisions. The potential benefits of the use of augmented reality may allow future doctors to virtually perform surgeries on pre-existing patients with the capability of personalizing procedures. AR might also be helpful for general medical visualization tasks in the surgical room giving surgeons access to both types of data, virtual and real. 

<br>
<br>
This information can aid in more precise tasks such as, displaying where to drill a hole into the skull for brain surgery, or where to perform a needle biopsy of a tiny tumor- both of these procedures are associated with a high amount of injury. Another category of augmented reality applications is the assembly, maintenance, and repair of complex machinery. Instructions would be easier to understand if they were not only manuals with text and pictures, but rather as 3D drawings superimposed upon the actual equipment showing step-by-step tasks and how to do them. These superimposed 3D drawings can be animated, making the directions even more explicit.

With the current trend of growth, it is believed that people will begin to incorporate technology, such as augmented reality, into their daily lives the in the years to come.<br><br>
With a growing demand and development for this technology, augmented reality is seen as one of the largest potential markets for many companies. The potential for augmented reality would allow for the evolution of the consumer bridging the gap from the store to the home. In theory, consumers would be able to try or use a product in the virtual world to determine if they would like to buy. In several fields, such a medical, military, education and industry, augmented reality has the capability to proliferate and flourish.

                            Augmented Reality allows users and researchers the capability to superimpose virtual designs and parts to determine aesthetic, structural, and viable parts. As augmented reality is becoming more commonly utilized, new objects and designs are allowed to be tested on different surfaces and environments. Organizations and institutions such as MindWalker are utilizing augmented reality as a mechanism to test prototypes designed on CAD software to aid the restoration of walking for those who have undergone spinal cord injuries.

                    <p>Augmented reality has many benefits, including medical, commercial, and educational. Treating and curing PTSD, being produced for the multi-billion dollar gaming industry, and being used to expose students to better, three-dimensional environments that professors previously couldn't do. These and more are the highlights of the tremendous benefits that can be associated with augmented reality.</p>
<br><br>

<p>The increasing popularization of augmented reality nowadays may appear innovative and entertaining, but it should not be treated as simple fun and games. Games such as Pokémon Go may be fun and a huge source of income, however there a significant amount of news reports over people who have been injured. People using augmented reality often become so immersed in it that they lose all common sense, and it's careless and irresponsible usage can lead to dangers in privacy, physical safety, and mental safety.</p>

                                    <h4>Medical Benefits</h4>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>AR might also be helpful for general medical visualization tasks in the surgical room. Surgeons can detect some features with the naked eye that they cannot see in MRI or CT scans, and vice versa. AR would give surgeons access to both types of data simultaneously. This information might also guide precision tasks, such as displaying where to drill a hole into the skull for brain surgery or where to perform a needle biopsy of a tiny tumor. The information from the noninvasive sensors would be directly displayed on the patient, showing exactly where to perform the operation.Several projects are exploring this application area. At UNC Chapel Hill, a research group has conducted trial runs of scanning the womb of a pregnant woman with an ultrasound sensor, generating a 3D representation of the fetus inside the womb and displaying that in a see through HMD. The goal is to endow the doctor with the ability to see the moving, kicking fetus lying inside the womb, with the hope that this one day may become a "3D stethoscope."

                                    <h4>Educational Benefits</h4>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Augmented reality is changing the way many are viewing education. Applications such as the Aurasma app are changing the way students interact with the world around them, creating realistic models of cells to explain the inner workings of cellular and molecular biology, transporting users to the parisian skyline in geography classes, and allowing students to visualize how history unfolded right in their eyes. The integration of AR and HUD technologies are game changers for education is and will be taught in the future. The beauty of Augmented Reality is that learning experiences can be as easy or as complex as you want it to be. You can create your own, or download one of the numerous pre-existing applications. This allows students to easily create visual and audible experience in a matter of minutes. </p>

                                    <h4>Commercial Benefits</h4>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>AR produces a completely unique method for several industry jobs- allowing parts to be visually viewed and superimposed to the manufacturing process- clearing up several misnomers and incorrect builds. The current amount of AR, although limited, is growing in the industrial field with companies such as ABB. The problem ABB faced was that almost all of their products are simply too large to put on display at a tradeshow. They build and commission complete turnkey power supply and network management solutions for railways. So, as you might imagine, their products are BIG. By using an Augmented Reality system, ABB is able to demonstrate to its customers the very latest technology in ways that are simply not possible using any other technology. They are able to use the interactive 3D images to show how the products are built, demonstrate individual features and it is a very positive aid for sales reps. In initial reports, the eye catching display increased the “on stand dwell time” of potential clients by 15 minutes and, according to the company’s own website, generated a larger pool of qualified leads.

                                    <p>While there are certain benefits to the usage of Augmented reality, it should be noted that there are also certain dangers associated with it. Its connectivity to things such as the internet or radio waves pose as a threat to privacy, as connection to certain malicious channels could pose a potential security threat to dangerous connections that the user may or may not have control in connecting to. Important information, such as location, can then be obtained by hackers and used to harm you or someone you care about.</p>

                                    <p>Specialists have noted that after a mere 20 minute immersion, participants can already begin to feel headaches and a sense of illness, assumedly due to a lack of real world stimuli. Furthermore, while augmented reality is currently being used to help soldiers cope with and overcome their traumas due to PTSD, there are those that worry that the technology could be used to do the opposite, to inflict trauma on victims</p>

                                    <p>While augmented reality may appear all fun and games to those not well versed in the to, there are some safety concerns associated with the topic. Augmented reality relies on the usage of “triggers” such as QR codes, images, or location, and hackers who are able to tinker with the augmented reality’s connectivity can trick people into doing certain dangers action. In addition, people not paying attention to their surroundings may walk into oncoming dangers, emphasizing the importance of being aware of yourself and staying safe during the usage of AR.</p>

                            <h5><strong>The Origin of EDD</strong></h5>
                            <p>Since the school was established, our original teachers got together and wanted to establish a course that would distinguish students from others, as a result the "Research and Design program was established". This program required students to solve a common problem in our world using their previous knowledge acquired in their past 3 years of engineering coursework. The results of this program has been astonishing. Multiple patents have been filed on some of the ideas that students created, and better yet in 1998 PLTW asked the science academy to incorporate this course into their national curriculum. There is no doubt that EDD has made a significant impact and will continue to do so.</p>

                                        project providing an insight of the field of electrical engineering.</p>

                                        <strong>The Truss Project</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Class: Principles of Engineering</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Through the truss project, students in POE understood how different types of trusses behave differently when put under strain and tested destructively. They were then asked to apply this understanding and build their own truss, first testing it on MD Solids and then constructing it with balsa wood. Students were ranked based on their performance in comparison to the rest of their peers in the class. The truss project was a successful hands on learning experience for these future engineering students, especially those hoping to specialize in the civil branch of this diverse field.</p>
